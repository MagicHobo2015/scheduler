inputs: busyschedule, workingPeriod, Duration

start with working period, keep the latest start time, and the earliest stop

freetime = range(startTime, Endtime, duration)

for person in schedules:
    for block in person:
        remove each block of time from freetime.
return freetime

Actually, some thoughts...

Since it has to be read from a file, (O(n)), It would be prudent to just loop through it once
    manipulating the data at each loop. Something like:

    Open the file.
    Get the raw data from the file. broke into lines.
    close the file.
    initialize the combined_schedule set().
    loop through each line:
        split the line at '=' will give two halfs, (except the duration), var_name, and var_value
        the value gets eval'd.
        if var_name is schedule: # value = [[ '7:00', '8:30'],  ['12:00', '13:00'],  ['16:00', '18:00']]
            <ExpandTheRange> # i.e. [ '7:00', '8:30'] --> [7:00, 7:30, 8:00, 830]
            add the expanded range to combined_schedule if its not in there.
        if var_name is DailyAct:
            check current DailyAct if start time is later or stop time earlier keep it.
        if var name is duration:
            # here we know that all the schedules are in and we have the last DailyAct, so wrap everything up.
